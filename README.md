# portfolio

Use this repo as a starting point to build a simple portfolio to show your work.  There's a home page and a work page but you can re-use bits of these pages in order to create additional pages. The goal is to be able to have something to display your work immediately.

Fork/Import Repo: To use this repo either click the FORK button, which will allow you to keep it loosely connected to this repo in case of changes, or find the PLUS button on the top left and choose IMPORT REPOSITORY.  If you choose to fork rather than import, the name of your repo will be "portfolio", which is a decent name once you turn your repo into a website.  The url in this case would be something like:

https://github.io/username/portfolio

GitHub Pages: In order to turn your repo into a website by using GitHub Pages, find SETTINGS at the top of the screen then scroll down and on the left select PAGES.  Then you'll need to identify a branch to turn into a website, and you'll choose MAIN.  Once you save, your repo will be turned into a website.  EXPECT A DELAY: It can take up to 5-10 minutes for your work to update.  When you create your initial site, reload/refresh the SETTINGS page that you're on and you'll eventually see the URL for your GitHub Page.

Editing: Once you have your repo and GitHub page website working, you can either clone the repo to your local machine and work there, or edit online.  If you want to edit online, you can click the pencil icon (edit) and then look for github.dev, which opens a minimal online version of VSCode.  Once you've edited your page, you can use CTRL + G (or CMD + G) and commit your changes to the file.  Here's a url about github.dev:

Design Notes: The design is provided by Bootswatch and currently uses the spacelab theme.  Search for 'Bootswatch" and find other themes if you'd like to change it.  To change the theme, find the sylesheet reference in the files and remove "spaclab" and replace it with a different theme, for example "cerulean".  View the Bootswatch website for more info on how additional HTML/CSS components can be added.  Bootswatch themes are built on the Bootstrap front end framework and our files utilize CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) to provide the required JS and CSS files for all of this to work for us.
